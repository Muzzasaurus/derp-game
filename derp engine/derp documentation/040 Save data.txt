The save system doesn't use hardcoded values like engines commonly do. Instead,
save data is stored in a save map as key-value pairs.

The save_set and save_get functions are used to access saved data. Data saved
with save_set will be saved only when the player saves. Data saved with
save_set_persistent will be saved even if the player restarts immediately.

If a value hasn't been set yet, save_get will return its default argument, or
0 if none is provided. This means you don't have to worry about initializing
save values anywhere.

For more specific documentation check the specific functions. For
simple examples, look at the GameClear or Item objects.

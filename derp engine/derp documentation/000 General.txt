The data folder stores all of the game's sound assets. However, as it
technically isn't part of the .gm82 project format, Game Maker doesn't copy it
or save it on its own, meaning you need to do it manually. It's recommended to
copy the project folder to make a new copy instead of Save As.

The sample rooms go out of their way to try and show off everything. Look at
them to get familiar with the engine or to see how something specific is done.

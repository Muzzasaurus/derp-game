Triggers are similar to YoYoYo Engine Verve Edition's triggers, but simplified
and with trigger makers, a new alternative interface that suits the room editor
better.

The trigger makers are objects you place in the room editor, and using the
fields system set their  trigger id and link them to an instance that it
affects. The remaining fields are all the properties of the specific action.

The sample rooms come with a whole room dedicated to triggers. Use it as a
reference.

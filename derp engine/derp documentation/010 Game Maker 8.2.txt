Rundown of major differences from Studio:

Game Maker 8.2 gets updated! If something doesn't work, try reinstalling Game
Maker 8.2 first if you haven't done so recently. I also ask a related request,
please update your engine copy before starting a new project.

Code changes
No ++, --, get used to it.
No enums, instead see the constants menu on the toolbar (blue C icon).
No quick var declarations, hence the long lines of var declarations. I tried
to underscore var names to make it clear what is and isn't a local variable.

Room editor
Quickly turn it on and off with the last icon on the toolbar. The new editor
contains its own guide on its toolbar. Most creation code functionality is
replaced by the fields system, accessed with the bottom left button on any
selected instance. Check sample rooms for examples, and the documentation
included in the Game Maker 8.2 installer folder for more advanced usage.

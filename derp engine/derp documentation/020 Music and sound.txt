The Game Maker 8.2 Sound extension greatly improves Game Maker's sound
capabilities, but it requires audio to be stored externally instead of inside
the project. The data folder isn't part of your project, it doesn't get resaved
if you save under a new name, and it doesn't get exported to the compiled game.

If you forget to include the data directory, an error will tell you so.

Sound and music files can be .wav, .ogg, or .mp3.

For examples on how sounds are used and referred to, you can check the
music_get_room_bgm or player_shoot scripts, or the sound triggers in
rSampleTriggers. For a list of sounds, simply look into the data folder.
